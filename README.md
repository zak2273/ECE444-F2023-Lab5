## Test driven development pros and cons
   
**Benefits of Test-Driven Development**

TDD encourages developers to write code that meets the specified requirements. This leads to higher code quality and reduces the likelihood of defects in the final product.   

TDD also offers a suite of automated tests that can be run at any time to check if new changes introduce regressions or break existing functionality.   

Since tests are run frequently, TDD fits well within the agile development process since issues can be identified and addressed more quickly, which also saves time in the long run.   

Lastly, TDD can give developers and stakeholders greater confidence in the codebase, knowing that it is thoroughly tested and reliable.   

**Drawbacks of Test-Driven Development**

Firstly, TDD requires writing tests before or during the coding process which can slow down initial development. Some developers may see this as a drawback when they need to meet tight deadlines. Also, maintaining a large suite of tests can add some overhead to the development process, as tests need to be updated when the code changes.   

TDD may not cover every aspect of a system, and some critical edge cases might be overlooked. Complementary testing approaches (e.g., exploratory testing) may be needed to fill these gaps.   

Lastly, some developers may resist TDD due to the perception that it is too rigid or bureaucratic.
